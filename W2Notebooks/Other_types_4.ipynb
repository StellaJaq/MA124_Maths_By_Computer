    "Python provides many built-in data types, in particular the sequence types (containers) — `list`, `tuple`, `range`, and also a text type `str` (*str* stands for *string* which is a generic computer term for a sequence of text characters). We will show examples covering the basics of these data types that you will need. \n",
