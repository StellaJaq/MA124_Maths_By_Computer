    "# Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is a powerful way to refer to multiple elements of sequences. Slicing permeates many manipulations of vectors and matrices, and it is used extensively in scientific coding. It is not difficult in principle, but it can appear cryptic in some circumstances. We introduce it here so that you will recognise it, but will return to it as needed later in the course.\n",

    "Let s be a string, or a list, then \n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[i]` is the ith item or element of s. (This we have seen already and is a trivial slice.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[i:j]` is a slice of s from i to j, meaning the elements starting with i and with ending j-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[i:j:k]` slice of s from i to j in steps of k. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the similarity to the notation for range, except here one uses `:` to denote a slice. Importantly, you can leave either start or stop blank, in which case the start is zero and stop is the length of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[:]` is a slice from `0` to `len(s)`, meaning elements `s[0]` to `s[len(s)-1]`, that is all elements of `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[::]` same as `s[:]` since again default values are used for start, stop and step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[n:]` is a slice from `n` to `len(s)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[::k]` is slice from `0` to `len(s)` in steps of k\n",

    "Negative start or stop indicates backwards from the end of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[-1]` is the last element of s.\n",
    "- `s[-n:]` is a slice from `len(s)-n` to `len(s)`, .i.e. the last n elements of s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative step counts backwards from the end\n",
    "\n",
    "- `s[::-1]` is all the elements of s in reverse order.\n",
